 		in a value from an Init proc, and have idents be the same

17 Jul 85	Consistency checker does not use MODPATH to find object
		files...must be in dir you are compiling from.  Then it

		mod2 doesn't common subexpression static offsets

15 Apr 87	movl a, b; tstl b should have tstl removed

16 Apr 87	Optimized code allocates space for temps that are in registers.
		In many cases everything in register and could dump sp:=sp-a103

16 Apr 87	Dbx changes to support subrange register vars

16 Jul 87	Use movc3 for long (loop only) copies

22 Jul 87	Automatic recompiling with the compiler doesn't take into
		account Makefiles that compile some files specially (like
		no -C)

24 Jul 87	Try using "movab const(rx),ry" rather than "addl3 $const,rx,ry"

28 Jul 87	Inline functions should return directly into var on left of
		assignment if possible.  Or at least make it into r0?

 		which there can be several induction variables per loop.
		If multiplication of the index is involved, the index must
		be kept separate from the derived induction variable.

27 Apr 88	-m flag needs to know HOW to make modules, not just what flags
		to use.  I want to say -m"make $.o" so special processing on
		Scanner.mod happens

27 Apr 88	Titan needs GenCheckExpr finished: CHECKSUBARRAY

28 Apr 88	Modula-2 storage allocator is slow.  Try my new one.

17 Nov 89	Dynamic set constructors are broke on both Titan and VAX.  They
		don't always or in the singleton or range.

17 Nov 89	Alignment restriction is screwed up by allocating 32-bit
		checkword at beginning of dynamic storage.

15 May 90	It would be nice to have FROM ... IMPORT QUALIFIED ...;

16 May 90	INCL and EXCL require sets to be byte-aligned, but should work
		for bit-aligned sets as well

16 May 90	Enums on VAX should take 8 or 16 bits if small enough.

31 May 90	ARRAY OF WORD, BYTE, should ensure alignment divisible by 32
		or 8, and maybe size also divisible by 32 or 8?
