(* This defines an interface to the C math library.			*)
(* REAL operations are done by the C double routines after converting   *)
(* to LONGREAL.  LONGREAL operations simply change the name of the      *)
(* procedure.								*)

(* Note: Since this module simply calls the C math library, there is an extra *)
(*  procedure call for each routine.  It is more efficient to import the *)
(*  longreal routines from the longmath module.  For real operations, use *)
(*  longfloat and float to convert the parameters and  results. *)
