DEFINITION MODULE strings;

(* string module:  make strings easier to deal with *)
(* note: someday these operations will be builtin and inline *)

(* this module generally expects to work with null-terminated strings *)
(*  and ignores characters after the first null *)

PROCEDURE Compare (CONST a, op, b : ARRAY OF CHAR) : BOOLEAN;
	(* a and b are the null-terminated operands to compare *)
	(* op is "=", "#", "<>", "<", ">", "<=", or ">=" *)
	(* assertion fails if bad op *)

PROCEDURE Assign (VAR toString : ARRAY OF CHAR; CONST fromString : ARRAY OF CHAR);
	(* copies fromString to toString, stops at null or end of fromString *)
	(* adds a null at the end of toString if there is room *)
	(* gets a subscript error if toString cannot contain fromString value *)

PROCEDURE Append (VAR toString : ARRAY OF CHAR; CONST fromString : ARRAY OF CHAR);
	(* appends fromString to toString starting at first null in toString *)
	(* stops at null or end of fromString *)
	(* adds a null at the end of toString if there is room *)
	(* gets a subscript error if toString cannot contain appended value *)

PROCEDURE Length (CONST string : ARRAY OF CHAR) : CARDINAL;
	(* returns the number of characters in string before the first null *)

END strings.
